## Plotly and Dash

While Matplotlib and Seaborn are good tools for exploratory data analysis, there are other, more flexible interactive data viz tools. It will be tremendously beneficial for you to learn both Plotly and Dash as part of your training. For security reasons, we'll only use Dash and Plotly in offline mode.

This folder carries three Jupyter notebooks:

* Matplotlib.ipynb : A refresher on using Matplotlib with our data on Unemployment

* Plotly.ipynb : An introduction to Plotly, with some useful links to the official website. We'll revisit the exercise in the Matplotlib notebook to show you how to leverage different tools and generate the same visuals. 

* Dash.ipynb : This is an introduction to Dash, and we'll go through some exercises, including the one used previously; leveraging Plotly Graph Objects.

Additional Exercises:

The following are additional exercises using Plotly, the solutions for which can be found in Plotly_Solutions.ipynb. 

1. Create individual violin plots of the distribution of unemployment rates for counties in each year.

2. Do the same with box plots.

3. Compare unemployment rate distributions for pairs of years using histograms.

4. Look at mean unemployment rates for each year in Alabama alone. Plot the total population against the unemployed population using a line graph.

Happy learning!
